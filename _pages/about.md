I am Jingbo Wang (王境博 in Chinese), a third-year undergraduate student at South China University of Technology (SCUT). Currently, I am an intern at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of [Haoang Li](https://sites.google.com/view/haoangli/homepage). I also work closely with [Wenxuan Song](https://songwxuan.github.io/) and [Han Zhao](https://h-zhao1997.github.io/), whose guidance and support have been invaluable to my research.

**Goal**: Pushing the boundaries of the world through robotics.
